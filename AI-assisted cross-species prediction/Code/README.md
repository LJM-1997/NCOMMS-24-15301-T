# Introduction of code and data
This is the implementation for cross-substrate and cross-photocatalyst prediction, which includes two main parts: **'Data preprocessing'** and **'Model building'**.

## Data preprocessing
* A step-by-step workflow in ``$ data_preprocessing.ipynb`` is provided to show the preprocessing of the data. 
* This section includes the environment setup, the mordred fingerprint generation and the dimension-reduction module, which takes **Photocatalysis_data.csv** as original data input.
* The data after preprocessing is also provided in **data_after_preprocessing.csv**. 

## Model building
* A step-by-step workflow in ``$ cross_validation.ipynb`` is provided to show the model training and the experimental results.
* This section takes **data_after_preprocessing.csv** as input.
* The ``$ cross_validation.ipynb`` also includes the cross-validation code and the results for cross-substrate and cross-photocatalyst prediction.
