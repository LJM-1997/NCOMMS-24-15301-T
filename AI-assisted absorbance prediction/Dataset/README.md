# Dataset used for the section 'AI-assisted absorbance prediction'
The **dataset** was used in the **AI regression models**, including the selection of PCA mode and training set ratio, the optimization of hyperparameters, the cross-validation studies, and the prediction of steady-state absorbance data.

In the dataset, as shown in **Figure 4A**, each row shows the data of a condition screening experiment, including the **reaction conditions** (i.e., 8 variables) as well as the **absorbance results**
(i.e., 40 recordings for non-steady-state absorbance signal peaks, and the change in steady-state absorbance) of the experiments.

There are 6 worksheets in the dataset, with each of the 1st to the 5th worksheets of the xlsx file containing all the 2,400 absorbance data obtained from the condition screening for each substrate species, respectively. The **6th worksheet** of the xlsx file summarizes **all the 12,000 absorbance data** obtained from the condition screening including all 5 substrate species.
