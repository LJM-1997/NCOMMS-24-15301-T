# Dataset used for 'AI-assisted absorbance prediction'
The dataset was used for 'AI-assisted absorbance prediction', including the .

In the dataset, as shown in Figure 4A, each row shows the data of a condition screening experiment, including the conditions (i.e., 8 variables) as well as the results
(i.e., 40 recordings of non-steady-state absorbance, and the change in steady-state absorbance) of the experiment.

There are 6 sheets in the dataset, with each of the 1st to the 5th sheets containing all the 2,400 absorbance data obtained from the condition screening for each substrate species, respectively. The 6th sheet summarizes all the 12,000 absorbance data obtained from the condition screening including all 5 substrate species.
