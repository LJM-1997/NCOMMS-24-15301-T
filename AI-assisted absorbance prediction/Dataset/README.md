# Dataset used for the section 'AI-assisted absorbance prediction'
The **dataset** was used in the **AI regression models**, including the selection of PCA mode and training set ratio, the optimization of hyperparameters, the cross-validation studies, and the prediction of steady-state absorbance data.

In the dataset, as shown in Figure 4A, each row shows the data of a condition screening experiment, including the **conditions** (i.e., 8 variables) as well as the **results**
(i.e., 40 recordings of non-steady-state absorbance, and the change in steady-state absorbance) of the experiment.

There are 6 sheets in the dataset, with each of the 1st to the 5th sheets containing all the 2,400 absorbance data obtained from the condition screening for each substrate species, respectively. The **6th sheet** summarizes **all the 12,000 absorbance data** obtained from the condition screening including all 5 substrate species.
